# Project BA3
In this repository I find my code from last year for the Hopfield network. 

**For each exercice session, the plan is to**: 

- read in depth the topic of the project of the week, annotate and highlight the pdf
- look at last year's code to get an idea of how we did it
- look at the code of the groups and make sure that everything is fine

All this is done on sunday, so the day before the exercice session. 

**Organisation for the code of the groups**: 

- git clone each group repository on local computer
- each week, `git clone` the group repository to get the newest version
- execute the code and see if it works 

**Feedback for the groups each week**: 
- for each group write down what is *good*, what is *bad* and what *can be improved* and how
- spend *20 min* with each group in the first hour and then go back to those who have troubles
